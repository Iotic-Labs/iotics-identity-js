# Simple manual test to verify installation

The nodejs example can be run either via the `iotics-identity-js/Makefile`
(`make test-node`, see main README for further details) for testing the package in development
or via

```
npm install
node ./example.mjs
```

to test the deployed package, whose version is defined in `./package.json`.
